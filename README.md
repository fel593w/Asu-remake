This is ÅSU!! witch you might think sounds like OSU! (specaly if you know sweden) and thats becuse this is a remake of OSU! using Modedlus, it is used to test the engine and not as a serius project. For now it's only recreating Osu! midi mode.

The name comes from that OSU! pronounced in a serten way makes the O of "OSU" sound like an Å in swedish witch is why it is "ÅSU". the two ! is becuse why not??

# How to build

# Modedlus
